        "The JenWARE onesies were the hit of the baby shower. The custom letter "a" and handmade quality made this gift really stand out among the cookiecutter
clothes from the department store."<br/><br/>
"Thanks for the cool JenWARE barware. I couldn't wait until I found "Mr. Right," so I just bought a set for myself! My friends always want to know where I
got them so I send them to your site."
